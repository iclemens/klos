KLoS

This is the source code to the KLoS hobby operating system. I wrote this a few years back to learn more about how computers and operating systems function.

While it boots and can run very simple applications, it is **very badly designed** and severely **lacking** in all but a few features. The name is Dutch for *screwed* because that is what you are if you try to run it.
